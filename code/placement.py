# This file is for looking at student placement.
# Tasks:
# Need to get students' first math for old placement.
# students' first grade in class of first placement.
# students' new placement categories under new system.
# how the categories line up with new courses.
# how new cousrses line up with old courses.
# is the new placement more, less, or the same in terms of difficulty.
# did the students pass



# From best to worst categorisation of outcomes.
#1  student previously placed in less advanced class is placed in more
#   advanced class: desired by new system.

#2  placed at same level and passed under in old placement: nothing wrong.

#3  placed less advanced but previously passed: undesirable.

#4  placed more advanced but previously failed: obviously bad.

#5  placed at same level and failed: nothing wrong?

#6  placed at lower level and previously failed: obviously improved.

# The other question that can't be answered here is whether the student
# failed a class for reasons other than placement.
